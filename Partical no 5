Chhatrapati shivaji Maharaj

<p>

Shivaji Bhonsle, also known as Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj, was born on 16th February 1627.

He was the son of Shahji and Jijabai.

At an early age, Shivaji got the right education from his mother and father.

His indomitable spirit and intelligence were off the chart.

<br><br> ☛ He grew up to be a formidable ruler and united the different kingdoms to form the

Maratha Empire.

<br><br> ☛ When Virat got his first ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111, it was worth the

wait

for him to return to the national squad.

<br><br> ☛ His intelligence and valour made the Mughal Empire and other rulers shiver in fear.

His enemy, Adil Shah wanted to kill him. He sent his commander,

Afzal Khan to trick him and kill him on the spot.

<br><br> ☛ Shivaji was one step ahead. He hid a dagger and killed Afzal Khan and fled.

He fought many battles and freed people from the tyranny of many rulers.

<br><br> ☛ This is why he got the name ‘Chhatrapati Shivaji’ or the people’s king.

He died in 1680 due to illness.
